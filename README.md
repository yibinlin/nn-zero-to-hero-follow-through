# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero - Follow Through

This project follows Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero) course, implementing neural networks from scratch.

## Setup

This project uses `uv` as the Python package manager. The initial setup with `uv` was completed in commit [`95bfd2c`](https://github.com/yibinlin/nn-zero-to-hero-follow-through/commit/95bfd2c4dfcfeee590cb038e3c9b4d9216a16c86), prior to Lecture 1 (micrograd_from_scratch_yay).

To get started:
```bash
uv sync
uv run jupyter lab
```
