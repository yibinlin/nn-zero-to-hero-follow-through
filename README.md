# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero - Follow Through

This project follows Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero) course, implementing neural networks from scratch.

## Setup

This project uses `uv` as the Python package manager. The initial setup with `uv` was completed in the previous git version.

To get started:
```bash
uv sync
uv run jupyter lab
